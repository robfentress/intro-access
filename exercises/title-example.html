    <h1>Web Accessibility</h1>
    <p>Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information
        and functionality.</p>
    <p>For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and/or text-to-Braille hardware. When text and
        images are large and/or enlargeable, it is easier for users with poor sight to read and understand the content. When links are underlined (or otherwise differentiated) as well as colored, this ensures that color blind users will be able to notice
        them. When clickable links and areas are large, this helps users who cannot control a mouse with precision. When pages are coded so that users can navigate by means of the keyboard alone, or a single switch access device alone, this helps users
        who cannot use a mouse or even a standard keyboard. When videos are closed captioned or a sign language version is available, deaf and hard-of-hearing users can understand the video. When flashing effects are avoided or made optional, users prone
        to seizures caused by these effects are not put at risk. And when content is written in plain language and illustrated with instructional diagrams and animations, users with dyslexia and learning difficulties are better able to understand the
        content. When sites are correctly built and maintained, all of these users can be accommodated without decreasing the usability of the site for non-disabled users.</p>
    <p>The needs that Web accessibility aims to address include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Visual: Visual impairments including blindness, various common types of low vision and poor eyesight, various types of color blindness;</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Motor/mobility: e.g. difficulty or inability to use the hands, including tremors, muscle slowness, loss of fine muscle control, etc., due to conditions such as Parkinson's Disease, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, stroke;</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Auditory: Deafness or hearing impairments, including individuals who are hard of hearing;</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Seizures: Photo epileptic seizures caused by visual strobe or flashing effects.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Cognitive/Intellectual: Developmental disabilities, learning disabilities (dyslexia, dyscalculia, etc.), and cognitive disabilities of various origins, affecting memory, attention, developmental "maturity," problem-solving and logic skills, etc.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assistive technologies used for web browsing</h2>
    <p>Individuals living with a disability use assistive technologies such as the following to enable and assist web browsing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Screen reader software, which can read out, using synthesized speech, either selected elements of what is being displayed on the monitor (helpful for users with reading or learning difficulties), or which can read out everything that is happening on the computer (used by blind and vision impaired users).</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Braille terminals, consisting of a refreshable braille display which renders text as braille characters (usually by means of raising pegs through holes in a flat surface) and either a mainstream keyboard or a braille keyboard.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Screen magnification software, which enlarges what is displayed on the computer monitor, making it easier to read for vision impaired users.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Speech recognition software that can accept spoken commands to the computer, or turn dictation into grammatically correct text - useful for those who have difficulty using a mouse or a keyboard.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Keyboard overlays, which can make typing easier and more accurate for those who have motor control difficulties.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Access to subtitled or sign language videos on the Internet for all deaf people.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Guidelines on accessible web design</h2>
    <h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h3>
    <p>In 1999 the Web Accessibility Initiative, a project by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 1.0.</p>
    <p>On 11 December 2008, the WAI released the WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation. WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive
        guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites.</p>
    <h4>Criticism of WAI guidelines</h4>
    <p>There has been criticism of the W3C process, claiming that it does not sufficiently put the user at the heart of the process. There was a formal objection to WCAG's original claim that WCAG 2.0 will address requirements for people with learning disabilities
        and cognitive limitations headed by Lisa Seeman and signed by 40 organisations and people. In articles such as "WCAG 2.0: The new W3C guidelines evaluated", "To Hell with WCAG 2.0" and "Testability Costs Too Much", the WAI has been criticised
        for allowing WCAG 1.0 to get increasingly out of step with today's technologies and techniques for creating and consuming web content, for the slow pace of development of WCAG 2.0, for making the new guidelines difficult to navigate and understand,
        and other argued failings.</p>
    <h3>Other guidelines</h3>
    <h4>Canada</h4>
    <p>In 2011, the Government of Canada began phasing in the implementation of a new set of web standards that are aimed at ensuring government websites are accessible, usable, interoperable and optimized for mobile devices. These standards replace Common
        Look and Feel 2.0 (CLF 2.0) Standards for the Internet.</p>
    <p>The first of these four standards, Standard on Web Accessibility came into full effect on July 31, 2013. The Standard on Web Accessibility follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA, and contains a list of exclusions that is updated
        annually. It is accompanied by an explicit Assessment Methodology that helps government departments comply. The government also developed the Web Experience Toolkit (WET), a set of reusable web components for building innovative websites. The
        WET helps government departments build innovative websites that are accessible, usable and interoperable and therefore comply with the government's standards. The WET is open source and available for anyone to use.</p>
    <p>The three related web standards are: the Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications for Mobile Devices, the Standard on Web Usability and the Standard on Web Interoperability.</p>
    <h4>Philippines</h4>
    <p>As part of the Web Accessibility Initiatives in the Philippines, the government through the National Council for the Welfare of Disabled Persons (NCWDP) board approved the recommendation of forming an adhoc or core group of webmasters that will help
        in the implementation of the Biwako Millennium Framework set by the UNESCAP.</p>
    <p>The Philippines was also the place where the Interregional Seminar and Regional Demonstration Workshop on Accessible Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to Persons with Disabilities was held where eleven countries from Asia - Pacific
        were represented. The Manila Accessible Information and Communications Technologies Design Recommendations was drafted and adopted in 2003.</p>
    <h4>Spain</h4>
    <p>In Spain, UNE 139803 is the norm entrusted to regulate web accessibility. This standard is based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.</p>
    <h4>Sweden</h4>
    <p>In Sweden, Verva, the Swedish Administrative Development Agency is responsible for a set of guidelines for Swedish public sector web sites. Through the guidelines, web accessibility is presented as an integral part of the overall development process
        and not as a separate issue. The Swedish guidelines contain criteria which cover the entire lifecycle of a website; from its conception to the publication of live web content. These criteria address several areas which should be considered, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">accessibility</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">usability</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">web standards</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">privacy issues</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">information architecture</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">developing content for the web</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Content Management Systems (CMS) / authoring tools selection.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">development of web content for mobile devices.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>An English translation was released in April 2008: Swedish National Guidelines for Public Sector Websites. The translation is based on the latest version of Guidelines which was released in 2006.</p>
    <h4>United Kingdom</h4>
    <p>In December 2010, the BSI (British Standards Institute) released the standard BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility. Code of practice. This standard effectively supersedes PAS 78 (pub. 2006). PAS 78, produced by the Disability Rights Commission and British
        Standards Institution, provided guidance to organisations in how to go about commissioning an accessible website from a design agency. It describes what is expected from websites to comply with the UK Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA),
        making websites accessible to and usable by disabled people. The standard has been designed to introduce non-technical professionals to improved accessibility, usability and user experience for disabled and older people. It will be especially
        beneficial to anyone new to this subject as it gives guidance on process, rather than on technical and design issues. BS 8878 is consistent with the Equality Act 2010 and is referenced in the UK government&rsquo;s e-Accessibility Action Plan as
        the basis of updated advice on developing accessible online services. It includes recommendations for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Involving disabled people in the development process and using automated tools to assist with accessibility testing</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">The management of the guidance and process for upholding existing accessibility guidelines and specifications.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>BS 8878 is intended for anyone responsible for the policies covering web product creation within their organization, and governance against those policies. It additionally assists people responsible for promoting and supporting equality and inclusion
        initiatives within organizations and people involved in the procurement, creation or training of web products and content. A summary of BS 8878 is available to help organisations better understand how the standard can help them embed accessibility
        and inclusive design in their business-as-usual processes.</p>
    <h4>Japan</h4>
    <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in Japan were established in 2004 as JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) X 8341-3. JIS X 8341-3 was revised in 2010 to adopt WCAG 2.0. The new version, published by the Web Accessibility Infrastructure Commission
        (WAIC), has the same four principles, 12 guidelines, and 61 success criteria as WCAG 2.0 has.</p>
    <h2>Essential components of web accessibility</h2>
    <p>The accessibility of websites relies on the cooperation of eight components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">the website itself - natural information (text, images and sound) and the markup code that defines its structure and presentation</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">user agents, such as web browsers and media players</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">assistive technologies, such as screen readers and input devices used in place of the conventional keyboard and mouse</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">users' knowledge and experience using the web</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">developers</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">authoring tools</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">evaluation tools</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">a defined web accessibility standard, or a policy for your organization (against which to evaluate the accessibility)</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>These components interact with each other to create an environment that is accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Web developers usually use authoring tools and evaluation tools to create Web content.<br />People ("users") use Web browsers, media players, assistive technologies or other "user agents" to get and interact with the content."</p>
    <h2>Guidelines for different components</h2>
    <h3>Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">ATAG contains 28 checkpoints that provide guidance on:</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">producing accessible output that meets standards and guidelines</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">promoting the content author for accessibility-related information</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">providing ways of checking and correcting inaccessible content</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">integrating accessibility in the overall look and feel</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">making the authoring tool itself accessible to people with disabilities</span></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">WCAG 1.0: 14 guidelines that are general principles of accessible design</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">WCAG 2.0: 4 principles that form the foundation for web accessibility; 12 guidelines (untestable) that are goals for which authors should aim; and 65 testable success criteria. The W3C's Techniques for WCAG 2.0 is a list of techniques that support authors to meet the guidelines and success criteria. The techniques are periodically updated whereas the principles, guidelines and success criteria are stable and do not change.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">UAAG[25] contains a comprehensive set of checkpoints that cover:</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">access to all content</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">user control over how content is rendered</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">user control over the user interface</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">standard programming interfaces</span></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Web accessibility legislation</h2>
    <p>Because of the growth in internet usage and its growing importance in everyday life, countries around the world are addressing digital access issues through legislation. One approach is to protect access to websites for people with disabilities by
        using existing human or civil rights legislation. Some countries, like the U.S., protect access for people with disabilities through the technology procurement process. It is common for nations to support and adopt the Web Content Accessibility
        Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 by referring to the guidelines in their legislation.</p>
    <h3>Australia</h3>
    <p>In 2000, an Australian blind man won a court case against the Sydney Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games (SOCOG). This was the first successful case under Disability Discrimination Act 1992 because SOCOG had failed to make their official website,
        Sydney Olympic Games, adequately accessible to blind users. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) also published World Wide Web Access: Disability Discrimination Act Advisory Notes. All Governments in Australia also have policies
        and guidelines that require accessible public websites; Vision Australia maintain a complete list of Australian web accessibility policies.</p>
    <h3>Brazil</h3>
    <p>In Brazil, the federal government published a paper with guidelines for accessibility on 18 January 2005, for public reviewing. On 14 December of the same year, the second version was published, including suggestions made to the first version of the
        paper. On 7 May 2007, the accessibility guidelines of the paper became compulsory to all federal websites. The current version of the paper, which follows the WCAG 2.0 guidelines, is named e-MAG, Modelo de Acessibilidade de Governo Eletr&ocirc;nico
        (Electronic Government Accessibility Model), and is maintained by Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management.</p>
    <p>The paper can be viewed and downloaded at its official website.</p>
    <h3>European Union</h3>
    <p>In February 2014 a draft law was endorsed by the European Parliament stating that all websites managed by public sector bodies have to be made accessible to everyone.</p>
    <h3>Ireland</h3>
    <p>In Ireland, the Disability Act 2005 requires that where a public body communicates in electronic form with one or more persons, the contents of the communication must be, as far as practicable, "accessible to persons with a visual impairment to whom
        adaptive technology is available" (Section 28(2)). The National Disability Authority has produced a Code of Practice giving guidance to public bodies on how to meet the obligations of the Act. This is an approved code of practice and its provisions
        have the force of legally binding statutory obligations. It states that a public body can achieve compliance with Section 28(2) by "reviewing existing practices for electronic communications in terms of accessibility against relevant guidelines
        and standards", giving the example of "Double A conformance with the Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)".</p>
    <h3>Israel</h3>
    <p>The Israeli Ministry of Justice recently published regulations requiring Internet websites to comply with Israeli standard 5568, which is based on the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. The main differences between the Israeli standard
        and the W3C standard concern the requirements to provide captions and texts for audio and video media. The Israeli standards are somewhat more lenient, reflecting the current technical difficulties in providing such captions and texts in Hebrew.</p>
    <h3>Italy</h3>
    <p>In Italy, web accessibility is ruled by the so-called "Legge Stanca" (Stanca Act), formally Act n.4 of 9 January 2004, officially published on the Gazzetta Ufficiale on 17 January 2004. The original Stanca Act was based on the WCAG 1.0. On 20 March
        2013 the standards required by the Stanca Act were updated to the WCAG 2.0.</p>
    <h3>Norway</h3>
    <p>In Norway, web accessibility is a legal obligation under the Act June 20, 2008 No 42 relating to a prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability, also known as the Anti-discrimination Accessibility Act. The Act went into force in 2009,
        and the Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs [Fornyings-, administrasjons- og kirkedepartementet] published the Regulations for universal design of information and communication technology (ICT) solutions [Forskrift
        om universell utforming av informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologiske (IKT)-l&oslash;sninger] in 2013. The regulations require compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) / NS / ISO / IEC 40500: 2012, level A and AA with
        some exceptions.</p>
    <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
    <p>In the UK, the Equality Act 2010 does not refer explicitly to website accessibility, but makes it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities. The Act applies to anyone providing a service; public, private and voluntary sectors. The Code
        of Practice: Rights of Access &ndash; Goods, Facilities, Services and Premises document published by the government's Equality and Human Rights Commission to accompany the Act does refer explicitly to websites as one of the "services to the public"
        which should be considered covered by the Act.</p>
    <h2>Website accessibility audits</h2>
    <p>A growing number of organizations, companies and consultants offer website accessibility audits. These audits, a type of system testing, identify accessibility problems that exist within a website, and provide advice and guidance on the steps that
        need to be taken to correct these problems.</p>
    <p>A range of methods are used to audit websites for accessibility:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Automated tools are available which can identify some of the problems that are present. Depending on the tool the result may vary widely making it difficult to compare test results.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Expert technical reviewers, knowledgeable in web design technologies and accessibility, can review a representative selection of pages and provide detailed feedback and advice based on their findings.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">User testing, usually overseen by technical experts, involves setting tasks for ordinary users to carry out on the website, and reviewing the problems these users encounter as they try to carry out the tasks.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Automated tools can process many pages in a relatively short length of time, but can only identify some of the accessibility problems that might be present in the website.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Technical expert review will identify many of the problems that exist, but the process is time consuming, and many websites are too large to make it possible for a person to review every page.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">User testing combines elements of usability and accessibility testing, and is valuable for identifying problems that might otherwise be overlooked, but needs to be used knowledgeably to avoid the risk of basing design decisions on one user's preferences.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ideally, a combination of methods should be used to assess the accessibility of a website.</p>
    <h2>Remediating inaccessible websites</h2>
    <p>Once an accessibility audit has been conducted, and accessibility errors have been identified, the errors will need to be remediated in order to ensure the site is compliant with accessibility errors. The traditional way of correcting an inaccessible
        site is to go back into the source code, reprogram the error, and then test to make sure the bug was fixed. If the website is not scheduled to be revised in the near future, that error (and others) would remain on the site for a lengthy period
        of time, possibly violating accessibility guidelines. Because this is a complicated process, many website owners choose to build accessibility into a new site design or re-launch, as it can be more efficient to develop the site to comply with
        accessibility guidelines, rather than to remediate errors later.</p>
    <h2>Accessible Web applications and WAI-ARIA</h2>
    <p>For a Web page to be accessible all important semantics about the page's functionality must be available so that assistive technology can understand and process the content and adapt it for the user. However, as content becomes more and more complex,
        the standard HTML tags and attributes become inadequate in providing semantic reliably. Modern Web applications often apply scripts to elements to control their functionality and to enable them to act as a control or other dynamic component. These
        custom components or widgets do not provide a way to convey semantic information to the user agent. WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium that specifies how to increase the
        accessibility of dynamic content and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript and related technologies. ARIA enables accessibility by enabling the author to provide all the semantics to fully describe its supported behaviour.
        It also allows each element to expose its current states and properties and its relationships between other elements. Accessibility problems with the focus and tab index are also corrected.</p>
