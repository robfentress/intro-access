    Screen magnifier
  </h1>
  <p>
    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  </p>
  <p>
    A screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computer's graphical
    output to present enlarged screen content. By enlarging part (or all) of a
    screen, people with visual impairments can better see words and images.
    This type of assistive technology is useful for people with some
    functional vision; people with visual impairments and little or no
    functional vision usually use a screen reader.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Use
  </h2>
  <p>
    The simplest form of magnification presents an enlarged portion of the
    original screen content, the focus, so that it covers some or all of the
    full screen. This enlarged portion should include the content of interest
    to the user and the pointer or cursor, also suitably enlarged. As the user
    moves the pointer or cursor the screen magnifier should track with it and
    show the new enlarged portion. If this tracking is jerky or flickers it is
    likely to disturb the user. Also, the pointer or cursor may not be the
    content of interest: for example, if the user presses a keyboard shortcuts
    that opens a menu, the magnified portion should jump to that menu. Pop-up
    windows and changes in system status can also trigger this rapid shifting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Screen magnifiers can be especially helpful for people suffering from low
    vision, including elderly users. However, in a 2001 paper, Vicki Hanson
    noted that people with low vision often also suffer from additional
    disabilities such as tremors.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Features
  </h2>
  <p>
    Ranges of 1- to 16-times magnification are common. The greater the
    magnification the smaller the proportion of the original screen content
    that can be viewed, so users will tend to use the lowest magnification
    they can manage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Screen magnifiers commonly provide several other features for people with
    particular sight difficulties:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Color inversion.</b> Many people with visual impairments prefer to
      invert the colors, typically turning text from black-on-white to
      white-on-black. This can reduce screen glare and is useful for elderly
      people suffering from age-related macular degeneration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Smoothing.</b> Text can become blocky and harder to recognise when
      enlarged. Some screen magnifiers use interpolation to smooth the text to
      compensate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Cursor customisation.</b> The mouse and text cursors can often be
      modified in several ways, such as circling it to help the user locate it
      on the screen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Different magnification modes.</b> Screen magnifiers can alter how
      they present the enlarged portion: covering the full screen, providing a
      lens that is moved around the un-magnified screen, or using a fixed
      magnified portion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Crosshairs.</b> Even with magnification, some users can find the
      mouse pointer hard to see. Crosshairs – especially when their size,
      color and opacity are customizable – can make the use of a pointing
      device easier.
    </li>
    <li>
      Screen reader. Some magnifiers come packaged with a basic screen reader,
      allowing whatever the user is pointing at to be read out.
    </li>
  </ul>
