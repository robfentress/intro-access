                            <li>People with <em>mobility</em> disabilities may not be able to fill out forms on your

                            <li>People with <em>cognitive</em> disabilities might have a hard time understanding the
                                message you are trying to convey; </li>
                            <li>People who are <em>deaf</em> may not be able to know what is going on in your videos.
                            </li>
                            <li>I could tell you that that people who are <em>blind or low vision</em> may miss out on
                                whatever you are trying to communicate with pictures</li>

                            or not, you, personally, will almost certainly be affected, at one point or another, by
                            someone's failure to consider the widest range of users and situations in their efforts to
                            communicate.

                                            governments</strong> provide qualified individuals with disabilities
                                        <strong>equal access</strong> to their <strong>programs, services, or
                                            activities</strong> unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of
                                        their programs, services, or activities or would impose an undue burden. And in
                                        case you were wondering, that burden refers to the
                                        organization as a whole, in our case, Virginia Tech, rather than your individual
                                        department.

                                usually just hear called ARIA, is a technical specification published by the World Wide
                                Web Consortium (W3C) that describes how to increase
                                the accessibility of web pages that have more application-like functionality. For
                                instance, it is now possible using Javascript to create custom-coded user interface
                                controls like interactive menus or tree views that are
                                not a part of the HTML specification, and often you'll see content on pages these days
                                that updates in response to user actions without having to load a whole new page. Unless
                                you properly set certain roles, states, and
                                properties, as specified in the ARIA standard, assistive technologies like
                                screen-reading software won't be able to give users information they need to interact
                                with those controls and won't inform users of when things
                                change on the page.</li>

                        <li><b>Read:</b> This workshop is going to talk about web accessibility primarily from the
                            perspective of how failure to do certain things will affect people with different kinds of
                            disabilities. I want to state up front that I'm not
                            doing this to try to invoke pity, but, rather, because it is hard to follow the rules
                            described in accessibility standards if you don't understand why they are there or who
                            specifically will be most affected by the choices
                            you make. As I hope I've made clear, making the web more accessible benefits everyone, but
                            for some people it doesn't just make things better, it makes them possible. </li>
                        <li>There are different ways to categorize disability, but here is a one high-level overview
                            that I hope will help organize the complexity. </li>

                                recently got in trouble for not having them, and so you'll notice that many of their

                                doesn't provide value, but, instead, just creates
                                extra noise that they must wade through to get to the information that is useful to

                                altogether won't do though, because images without alt tags
                                are still presented to the user, with the file name usually being what is announced.

                                name of the document that would be downloaded. This saves these users time by letting

                                users of the macOS screen reading software, VoiceOver. Where would I go if I clicked on

                            indicates when to reveal a fragment.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>You may have noticed a number of new elements in HTML5 whose purpose you were uncertain
                                of, since they appear to have no effect on the appearance or functionality of the page.
                            </li>
                            <li>Among these are * header, * nav, * main, * aside, * section, and * footer, and they are
                                considered landmark regions.</li>
                            <li>Although they may not have a visual effect on their own, "Landmarks provide a powerful
                                way to identify the organization and structure of a web page." </li>
                            <li>This structure can be defined using the tags I mentioned, or by adding the
                                <code>role</code> attribute to any tag and assigning one of the values that correspond
                                to those aforementioned sectioning tags. You can see those roles in the code listing.
                            </li>
                            <li>Some roles do not have a corresponding HTML5 sectioning element, such as "search". In
                                that case we can just add the role to a div, like this *.</li>
                            <li>"The use of landmarks roles support keyboard navigation to the structure of a web page
                                for screen reader users, and can be used as targets for author supplied 'skip links' and
                                browser extensions for enhanced keyboard navigation."</li>
                            <li>You should "provide labels to distinguish two page regions of the same type, such as
                                'main navigation' and 'sub-navigation' menus using a NAV element on the same page"</li>
                            <li>You can see that in the code listing where I have two nav tags and have differentiated
                                them by adding a label that indicatyes one is for site navigation and one is for page
                                navigation.
                            </li>

                            Accessible tables need HTML markup that indicates header cells and data cells and defines
                            their relationship. Assistive technologies use this information
                            to provide context to users. Header cells must be marked up with TH, and data cells with TD
                            to make tables accessible. For more complex tables, explicit associations may be needed
                            using scope, id, and headers attributes.

                            <li><b>Read:</b> Screen readers will generally read the content on the page in the order it
                                appears in the HTML. Usually this makes sense, but in some cases the order suggested by
                                the way the page looks doesn't match the order
                                in the code. Let me show you an example.</li>

                                    target="_blank">What is wrong with this?</a></li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> A user of the screen reader VoiceOver may read through the page essentially
                                one line at a time by pressing <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd>. If
                                we do that here, listen to what happens when
                                we get to the list of articles.</li>
                            <li>Use <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd> to read through the list of
                                articles.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> Notice how the screen reader didn't read things based on the columnar
                                layout. Why do you suppose that is</li>
                            <li>Right-click on the heading, <b>Heat wave linked to temperatures</b>, and choose
                                <b>Inspect</b> to bring up the Inspector.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> Notice here how the person who coded the page placed all of the titles of
                                the articles in a div with the class, <b>newsbar</b>. This styling made the titles
                                appear in a sort of row. The screen reader doesn't know
                                that the content is visually organized in columns and that the title of the article
                                should be read first, followed by the alt text for the pictures, and then the extract of
                                the story. Instead, it just reads content as it
                                appears in the code, which in this case doesn't match the visual presentation.</li>
                            <li>Go back to the slide</li>
                            <li>Reveal the next fragment</li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b> So the lesson here is that the order of content in the HTML should match
                                the order things should be read based on the visual presentation. Or if it is not
                                exactly the same, it should still make sense.</li>

                                SSB Bart--now LevelAccess--of an application that provides all this functionality and
                                more, ZoomText.

                            <li>Play video until <b>0:42</b>, which will show color, contrast, pointer, and cursor
                                enhancements. Then skip to <b>1:25</b>, where it talks about how magnification can
                                affect one's ability to notice form error notifications.

                            <li>Explain that the view, when zoomed in, follows the focus, so it is important to note
                                that, if something appears outside of a users field of view when they click a button, it
                                is often best to shift focus to whatever appears.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ask if they remember a similar issues from when we demonstrated form submission on the

                            <li><b>Read:</b> There are many ways to magnify content to make text more readable.
                                Magnification of the entire screen as shown is just one, and, as mentioned has the
                                disadvantage of requiring scrolling in two dimensions in order
                                to read text.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>One other way to magnify things that doesn't require separate software is to
                                        <b>use your browsers native zooming</b> functionality.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>For instance in Safari I can magnify the page by pressing <kbd>Command</kbd> +
                                        <kbd>+</kbd> or choosing <b>Zoom In</b> from the <b>View</b> menu.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>This will make the text bigger, but can cause problems with horizontal scrolling
                                        unless you are using responsive design techniques that transform the layout as
                                        the viewport size decreases, which is essentially what
                                        is happening when you use Browser Zoom.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Read:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Some people may not want to zoom the entire page, and may prefer to just make
                                        the text on the page bigger. For instance, you can <b>set your preferred text
                                            size</b> in Chrome's preferences window.</li>
                                    <li>This should not cause content to reflow, as with browser zoom, and, therefore,
                                        this may be a preferable strategy for some users. </li>
                                    <li>However, unlike browser zoom, this technique only works if the page has been
                                        coded to use relative units for font size. These relative units include em, rem,
                                        %, and keywords like large.</li>
                                    <li>If, instead, you have used absolute measures, such as pixels, points, or inches,
                                        they will not change when the user sets their preferred text size in their
                                        browser's preferences.</li>
                                    <li>Regardless, the key thing to keep in mind here is that users should be able to
                                        set their text to be up to 200% of its normal size one way or another, without
                                        any of the text becoming truncated or overlapping other content
                                        and thus becoming unreadable.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                ability to see color or differences in color. For instance, eople with normal vision
                                should see the number "74". Many people who are color
                                blind see it as "21", and those with total color blindness may not see any numbers.

                                employ are custom stylesheets and tools to enhance contrast. For instance, I knew one
                                user who on a certain site had trouble distinguishing
                                links from the text that surrounded the links in a paragraph, because the contrast ratio
                                between the two colors used was too small. He dealt with the problem by applying a
                                custom stylesheet that added an underline to all
                                links on that site.

                        <li><b>Read:</b> italics, cursive and decorative fonts are less easy to read. Bolded or larger
                            text is preferred to these as a way of indicating emphasis.</li>
                        <li>Reveal fragment.</li>
                        <li><b>Read:</b> Although there are no official minimum font size requirements in WCAG, usually,
                            you would not want to go below 16 CSS pixels. And, of course, this varies based on your
                            purpose. For instance, 16px text would generally
                            be too small for important text on slides.</li>
                        <li>Reveal fragment.</li>
                        <li><b>Read:</b> Densely packed text is tiring.</li>
                        <li>Reveal fragment.</li>
                        <li><b>Read:</b> Some people find it hard to read from emissive devices, so you should make sure
                            that your content formats in a readable way when printed.</li>
                        <li>Reveal fragment.</li>
                        <li><b>Read:</b> Text with poor contrast can make things less readable generally, not just for
                            people with visual disabilities.</li>
                        <li>Reveal fragment.</li>
                        <li><b>Read:</b> Lines of text that are longer than 72 characters wide can make it more
                            difficult for users to track to the next line and interfere with readability. Avoid long
                            paragraphs. Where it makes sense, use bulleted or numbered
                            lists to make content easier to digest.</li>
